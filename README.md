#Heart Attack Prediction System (Machine Learning)

A Python-based machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of a heart attack based on medical attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more.

This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and prediction using popular ML libraries like **scikit-learn**, **NumPy**, and **Pandas**.

##Features

- Predicts the risk of heart attack using machine learning
- Includes data cleaning & preprocessing pipeline
- Trained classification model (Logistic Regression / Random Forest / etc.)
- Simple prediction script for new input values
- Jupyter notebook for model training (optional)

##Model Performance

The model was evaluated using classification metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and support.

It achieved precision scores of 0.86 and 0.88, recall scores of 0.86 and 0.88, and F1-scores of 0.86 and 0.88 across the two classes.

The evaluation was performed on a dataset with 29 samples in one class and 32 samples in the other.

These results show that the model delivers consistent and balanced performance with strong predictive accuracy overall.
